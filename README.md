# On-Budget


## **Description**

- On-Budget is a personal budget tracking application that makes it easy to track deposits, withdraws, and transactions; whether or not you have internet connection. It is a progressive web application that can be downloaded on to mobile or desktop devices.
- This PWA was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ES6, Node, Express.js, MongoDb, indexedDB, and Heroku.
- The motivation behind On-Budget was a need to track personal finances while traveling in areas with limited connectivity.
- While developing On-Budget, I had the intention of growing my understanding of progressive web applications using service-workers, and managing offline functionality for web applications using indexedDB.

- Future development will include the ability for users to create an account to track their own personal budget! Keep an eye our for version_2 coming soon!
